# hello-world
just another repository

Hi people,
My name is Maurice Lewis and today starts my self taught journey into becoming a software developer.  I've taken some prpgramming classes in the past, but now I'm more focus of my goal in becoming a developer to create all of my ideas.

I am ready to take on this challege head on and start my own marathon Word to NIP!!!

Take this as my first entry on March 28,2020 as my steps as a REAL PROGRAMMER!!!!
